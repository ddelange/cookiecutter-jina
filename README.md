# cookiecutter-jina

## Notice

As of 26 August 2020 we are deprecating cookiecutter-jina. Unfortunately cookiecutter doesn't work well with a project of Jina's complexity, and it no longer supports any Jina version beyond 0.3.0. Rest assured we're currently working on alternative solutions to help developers quickly and easily create their Flows, which we will post here when they are ready.

Cookiecutter template for a Jina project

## Quick start

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Generate a Jina project:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:jina-ai/cookiecutter-jina
```

## Fork This / Create Your Own

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description.

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.
